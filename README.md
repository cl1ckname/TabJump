# Jump Tab

Jump Tab is a lightweight Chrome extension that lets you quickly navigate between tabs using keyboard shortcuts. Instead of manually clicking tabs, you can assign letters to tabs and jump to them instantly.

## Features

- Assigns letters/numbers (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) to open tabs in the current window.
- Display tab bindings temporarily in tab titles.
- Jump to a tab by pressing **Alt+Letter**.
- Works with multiple tabs (up to 64 for MVP).
- Minimal and distraction-free — no popups, overlays, or prompts.

## How to Use

1. Press **Alt+J** to activate Jump Tab mode.
2. Tab titles will be prefixed with letters/numbers corresponding to each tab.
3. Press **Alt+Letter** for the tab you want to jump to.
4. Jump Tab mode exits automatically after any key press and tab titles are restored.

> ⚠️ Note: Some browser or extension-reserved shortcuts (like `Alt+F`) may not work. Other Alt+Letter combinations are safe.
